# Embedded_Systems_lab

Lab1 is about functional simulation and implementation of a Gray Counter in Verilog using
the Xilinx Vivado toolset.
Lab2 is an introduction to the software part of an FPGA-based System On Chip.
Lab3 is guides you through the process of creating and adding a custom peripheral to the embedded system.
Lab4:
Besides new peripherals, FPGA fabric can be used to implement hardware accelerators to
offload computationally demanding tasks from the CPU.
Lab5:
In this lab you will first run and profile a software application (Sobel filter) on the ARM Cortex-A9 processor and you will profile the application to assess its
performance footprint.
